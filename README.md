## Research and development of magnetic resonance technologies

Output relating to my work on coupled-coil wireless-power transfer by magnetic resonance.

### Basic analytic arrangement

Using the HP[8601A]() Sweeper/Generator in _tracking generator mode_, one can observe the linearity of two 12.5mm-radius, 10-turn inductive-loop coils on a HP[141S]() Spectrum Analyzer.
